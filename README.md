
# 🧠 QnA Agent — Reflection-Based LangGraph System

A multi-step Question Answering Agent built using **LangGraph + LangChain + OpenAI**.

This project demonstrates a structured, state-driven AI system that:

- 🔎 Generates answers using LLMs  
- 📊 Evaluates answer quality using structured output  
- 🔁 Improves low-confidence answers using feedback  
- 🧩 Uses graph-based orchestration
